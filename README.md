# About

Flat light icon collection built from scratch (some based on existing designs).
Both SVG and PNG files have been loslessly compressed.

# Contents

- SVG (vector)
- PNG (256px)
- ICO (16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 256px)

# Differences

- 16px folder contains icons designed at 16px, which means they will perfectly scale to 32px, 48px and 256px.
  - 16px/outline folder contains icons consisting only of outlines
- 32px folder contains icons designed at 16px, which means they will perfectly scale to 32px and 256px.
- In summary
  - 32px icons might not look perfect at 48px.
  - All icons will look poorly at 24px (because it's an odd resolution, every other resolution is multiple of 16).
